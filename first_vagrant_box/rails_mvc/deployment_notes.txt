*** RoR DEPLOYMENT ***
# phusion is easier than puma, but both are options
# phusion has 2 versions: passenger & enterprise
# postgresql saves db separately from project folder so it won't deploy along with project, unlike sqlite which will
# sudo install stuff in ubuntu! esp if it has a library
scp -r secrets -i ~/pms/pem.key
